     This document describes the benefits of ARJ.  Pardon the commercial.
     Compression benchmark results are at the end of this document.


     1)  ARJ provides superior size compression to the other products
	 currently available on the PC.  In a few particular cases, other
	 archivers may produce slightly smaller archives than ARJ.

	 ARJ is particularly strong compressing databases, uncompressed
	 graphics files, and large documents.  One user reported that in
	 compressing a 9.0 megabyte database, PKZIP produced a compressed
	 file of size 1.8 megabytes, and ARJ produced a compressed file of
	 size 1.1 megabytes.

     2)  Of PKZIP, LHArc, PAK, ARC, ARJ, and HYPER, only ARJ provides the
	 capability of archiving files to multiple volume archives.  In
	 other words, ARJ can archive files directly to diskettes no matter
	 how large or how numerous the input files are.

	 It is possible to archive a 10 megabyte file to several diskettes
	 and to recover the file directly from the diskettes.  Other
	 archivers require that you compress the large file to hard disk
	 or large RAM drive and then slice the compressed file to fit on
	 diskettes.  To recover the original file involves reassembling the
	 compressed file on the hard disk from the diskettes and then
	 extracting the original file from the reassembled compressed file.
	 This option is not even possible if you lack the hard disk space.

	 This feature makes ARJ especially suitable for distributing large
	 software packages without the concerns about fitting entire files
	 on one diskette.  ARJ will automatically split files when
	 necessary and will reassemble them upon extraction without using
	 any extra disk space.

	 This multiple volume feature of ARJ makes it suitable as a "poor
	 man's" backup utility.  ARJ saves pathname information, file
	 date-time stamps, and file attributes in the archive volumes.	ARJ
	 can also create an index file with information about the contents
	 of each volume.  Files contained entirely within one volume are
	 easily extracted using just the one volume.

     3)  ARJ provides the facility to store EMPTY directories within its
	 archives.  This makes it easier to do FULL backups and also to
	 distribute software products that come with EMPTY directories.

     4)  Both ARJ self-extracting modules provide default pathname support.
	 That means that you can build self-extracting archives of software
	 directories containing sub-directories.  The end user of the
	 self-extracting archive does not have to type any command line
	 options to restore the full directory structure of the software.
	 This greatly simplifies software distribution.

     5)  The ARJ archive data structure with its header structure and 32
	 bit CRC provide excellent archive stability and recovery
	 capabilities.

     6)  ARJ provides a security envelope facility to "lock" ARJ archives.
	 A "locked" ARJ archive cannot be modified by ARJ.  This provides
	 some level of assurance to the user receiving a "locked" ARJ
	 archive that the contents of the archive have not been tampered
	 with.	Data integrity checks contribute to the security of the
	 ARJ "lock".

     7)  The myriad number of ARJ commands and options allow the user
	 outstanding flexibility in archiver usage.

     8)  You will also receive strong technical support from a software
	 author with many years of experience in software technical
	 support.



     COMPRESSION COMPARISON TEST RESULTS		June 28, 1991


     This benchmark archiver test uses the original PKZIP 1.10 distribution
     archive, PKZ110.EXE, as the base data to compress.  The PKZIP 1.10
     distribution archive totals 302196 bytes.


     ARCHIVER		PACKED SIZE   COMPRESS TIME   EXTRACT TIME
     ----------------	-----------   -------------   ------------

     ARJ   2.10  -m4	  145374	  1:30.9	 0:52.0
     ARJ   2.20  -m4	  144802	  1:07.7	 0:46.8

     PAK   2.51 	  138309	  2:26.2	 0:53.0
     LHARC 1.13c	  137450	  4:05.7	 1:46.1
     HYPER 2.50 	  136543	  2:30.4	 1:54.7
     PKZIP 1.10 	  136245	  2:12.0	 0:34.5

     ARJ   2.10  -m3	  135185	  1:47.2	 0:52.1
     ARJ   2.20  -m3	  132441	  1:30.4	 0:48.5

     ARJ   2.20  -m2	  130994	  1:49.5	 0:48.1
     LHA   2.12 	  130606	  2:39.1	 0:50.4

     ARJ   2.20 [-m1]	  129002	  2:14.0	 0:47.7
     ARJ   2.20  -jm1	  128114	  2:33.0	 0.47.6
     ARJ   2.20  -jm	  127992	  3:51.8	 0.47.6


     ARJ 2.20 produced the best COMPRESSION SPEED and COMPRESSION SIZE
     results in this test.  PKZIP had the fastest EXTRACTION SPEED.

     This test was run on a 8 MHz 8088 PC with 20 MB hard drive and 512 K
     ram.  The archives were created on and extracted from a ram disk.
