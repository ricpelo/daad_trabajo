   This archive contains ARJ version 2.20.  This is a full featured
   shareware release.  ARJ is free for non-commercial personal use.

   This software as originally released by the author came in an ARJ
   self-extracting archive with an ARJ-SECURITY envelope to prevent
   tampering.  Re-archival of this software will lose this security
   feature.

   UNARJ is now distributed separately in UNARJ220.EXE.


   MAJOR FEATURES OF ARJ INCLUDE:

   ARJ 2.20 currently ranks as the best in overall compression in terms of
   resulting archive size.

   Option to create multiple volume archives with one command making ARJ
   useful for making backups to multiple floppies or archiving a very large
   file to several floppies without "SLICE"ing.

   A separate conversion utility called REARJ to facilitate wholesale
   conversion of archives to the ARJ format.

   Option to store empty directories.

   Multiple string searching and context display within archives.

   Archive security envelope to resist tampering.

   A myriad of commands and options to provide outstanding flexibility in
   archiver usage.
