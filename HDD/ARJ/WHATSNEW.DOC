     This lists the user visible changes to ARJ from previous versions.


     ARJ 2.20

     UNARJ is now distributed separately.
     The ARJSFX (-je) and ARJSFXJR (-je1) have improved extraction speed.
	The "-je" module is slightly faster then "ARJ x".
     Added an internal identification string "aRJsfX" to the SFX modules.
     Removed the BIOS call in the SFX modules to be more MS-DOS generic.
     Methods 3 and 4 have been significantly improved in speed and
	compression.  Method 4 is about twice as fast as method 1.
     Improved the speed of all of the extraction methods.
     Simplified the extraction display when both filenames are the same.
     Added check for disk space to "-va" option.
     Added ARJ configuration file option to ARJ_SW to allow each ARJ
	command to have its own switch settings.
     Added beep to "-vv" option after last volume.
     Added "-d" option support to the "ARJ j" command.
     Added "-z" option support to ARJ archive modification commands in
	order to allow archive creation and commenting in one command.
     Added "-jl" option to limit filename displays to filespecs.
     Added "-jp" option support to provide a paged display facility.
     Added "-jw" option to direct extraction output to another file.
     Added "-jx" option support to extract functions for specifying
	starting output file position.
     Added "-jy" options to allow single key Y/N input on user queries
	and typeahead erase.
     Added REARJ "/a*" option to convert any archive type in an archive.
     Added REARJ "/b" option to execute a command before extraction.
     Added REARJ "/c" option to execute a command after extraction but
	before REARJ counts the files for later verification.
     Added REARJ "/f" option to support diskette archive conversions.
     Added REARJ "/w" option to set a working temp directory.
     Separated the file counts from the comment counts.
     Modified the context message prompt for the "w" command.
     Modified the "f" and "u" commands to not physically update an archive
	when no files have been added.
     Modified the switch character handling to allow different switch
	characters in ARJ_SW and the command line except when using "-ju".
     Modified the "ARJ o" command to abort on multiple volume archives.
     Modified "-$" to not return an error when there is no label to add.
     Modified the "-ji" option to append to already existing files.
     Fixed printf() statement in list_arc() in UNARJ.C.
     Fixed bug with "ARJ m -t1" when file is not text.
     Fixed bug scanning hidden directories with "-a" and "-a1" options.
     Fixed bug with "ARJ a -n" command.
     Fixed bug with "ARJ o"/ARJSORT handling of duplicates in archives.


     ARJ 2.10

     ** IMPORTANT NEWS ****************************************************

	ARJ utility developers should refer to UNARJ.DOC in UNARJ.ARJ
	concerning a bug in extended header processing in UNARJ.C and an
	ambiguous source statement in DECODE.C.

	The ARJ SFX (-je) and SFXJR (-je1) modules have been modified
	because of an undesirable interaction with TSR DIET 1.02b.  You
	should redo any ARJ SFX type archives with ARJ 2.20.  Here is a
	fast way to do it without recompressing:

	ARJ j newsfx oldsfx.exe -je

     **********************************************************************
