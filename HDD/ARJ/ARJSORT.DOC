    ARJSORT.BAT is a batch file provided to give the user the facility to
    sort the files in an ARJ archive.  ARJSORT allows sorting by file
    attribute, CRC value, date-time modified, file extension, filename,
    pathname, and compression ratio.  The sort order can be set for
    ascending or descending order.

    Usage:  ARJSORT archive [/order] [/r]
	    Where /order is one of the following:

		  /a = attribute       /o = ratio
		  /c = crc	       /p = pathname
		  /d = date/time       /s = size
		  /e = extension       /t = time
		  /f = filename

	    [/r]everse, if specified, must be the last option.

    ARJSORT has been designed to work at MS-DOS 3.3 and up.  The @ECHO
    command in ARJSORT.BAT may cause problems with other versions of DOS.

    ARJSORT uses the special ARJSORT.$$$ feature of the order command.	A
    list file named ARJSORT.$$$ is expected to be in a special format by
    the order command.	That format is produced by the ARJ v -jv1 command.
    ARJSORT requires the MS-DOS SORT program to be available for ARJSORT to
    work.  ARJSORT creates several temporary files named ARJSORT.$$?.
    These temporary files will be deleted at the end of the program.


    ARJSORT Examples:

    ARJSORT archive	  - Sort files in ascending alphabetical pathname
			    order.

    ARJSORT archive /r	  - Sort files in descending pathname order.

    ARJSORT archive /d	  - Sort files in chronological date-time modified
			    order.

    ARJSORT archive /d /r - Sort files in descending chronological
			    date-time modified order.

    ARJSORT archive /s	  - Sort files in ascending file size order.


    At ARJ release 1.10, ARJSORT.COM (compiled version of ARJSORT.BAT) is
    included with the ARJ software.  This program can be used in place of
    the ARJSORT.BAT.  This COM version is better for use in DOS BATCH files
    than ARJSORT.BAT.


    HISTORY:

    1.21 - Fixed deletion of temporary files.

    1.20 - Improved ARJSORT.$$$ processing so that EDLIN is not needed.

    1.10 - Added ARJSORT.COM.
