
     ARJ LICENSE POLICY 				   July 1991
     ------------------


     The ARJ archiver, the REARJ program, the ARJSFX module, the ARJSFXJR
     module, the DEARJ program, the ARJR program, and the associated
     documentation are copyright (c) 1990,91 Robert K Jung, all rights
     reserved.	The ARJ software may not be circulated in any incomplete or
     modified form, nor sold for profit, without written permission of the
     author.

     The ARJ archiver contains proprietary processes for which patent
     rights are being sought by the author.  Please note that ARJ
     compatible archivers can be built without infringing on any ARJ 2.20
     proprietary processes.  ARJ 1.10 is such a compatible archiver.

     If you distribute this software to others, you are required to
     distribute the ENTIRE package consisting of the following files:

     ARJ.EXE
     ARJ.DOC
     ARJ_BBS.DOC
     ARJSORT.BAT
     ARJSORT.COM
     ARJSORT.DOC
     CREDIT.CRD
     LICENSE.DOC
     ORDERFRM.DOC
     README.DOC
     REARJ.CFG
     REARJ.DOC
     REARJ.EXE
     REGISTER.EXE
     UPDATE.DOC
     WHATSNEW.DOC
     WHY_ARJ.DOC

     I strongly prefer that the files be distributed in the format
     originally released:  ARJ220.EXE with the ARJ-SECURITY envelope as
     created by the author.  If you must distribute the ARJ archive in
     another archive format, please archive the ARJ220.EXE as one file
     inside the other archive.	Re-archival of the software as separate
     files means losing the ARJ security envelope.

     You may NOT distribute the registered version of ARJ or any version of
     ARJR, and DEARJ except as noted in your ARJ license agreement.  ARJR
     is the ARJ program minus the help screens and SFX/SFXJR modules.
     DEARJ is the ARJR program minus the archive modification/creation
     functions.  ARJR and DEARJ are available only to ARJ LICENSEES.  See
     the ORDERFRM.DOC for ordering information.  Those who have made
     donations to ARJ may upgrade to a SITE LICENSE with full credit for
     your previous donation(s).  Please note that on your order.

     The use and/or sale of ARJ, ARJR, DEARJ, REARJ, ARJSFX, and ARJSFXJR
     (ARJ package) is subject to the following terms:


     PERSONAL USE:

     For personal non-commercial use, ARJ, ARJSFX, and ARJSFXJR may be
     freely used and shared with others.  There is no REQUIRED registration
     fee for non-commercial/non-institutional personal use.

     For personal non-commercial use, the program REARJ may be freely used
     only by ARJ users.  An ARJ user is one who uses ARJ on a regular
     basis.  Others who wish to use REARJ must purchase a site license for
     the ARJ package.

     However, if you find the ARJ package of value, a gift of ten dollars
     or any amount would be greatly appreciated.  Please remember that
     improvements to the ARJ package cannot happen without your support.
     You can help by sharing ARJ with others.

     You may, of course, register ARJ by ordering a standard site license.
     See the ORDERFRM.DOC for terms.


     BULLETIN BOARD SYSTEM (BBS) USE:

     ARJ and REARJ may be freely used on non-commercial computer bulletin
     board systems where ARJ is one of the supported primary archive
     formats.  The use of ARJ and/or REARJ on a BBS where ARJ is not one of
     the supported primary archive formats requires a site license.

     Support of ARJ involves allowing ARJ archives as uploads AND making
     ARJ archives available as downloads.

     A subscription BBS is not necessarily considered a COMMERCIAL BBS.  A
     BBS that is operated to make money is considered a COMMERCIAL BBS.  A
     BBS operated by a business for the purposes of the business is
     considered a COMMERCIAL BBS.


     INSTITUTIONAL/COMMERCIAL SITE LICENSE:

     Any corporation, institution, government agency or business wishing to
     use the ARJ software in the course of its internal business must
     purchase a SITE LICENSE.  A sample SITE LICENSE for the internal use
     of the ARJ software is included at the end of this document.  Please
     see the ORDERFRM.DOC or write for terms.

     Any corporation, institution, government agency or business may use
     the unregistered shareware version of ARJ only for evaluation purposes
     and only for a thirty day period.	After the thirty day period, you
     must either register ARJ or discontinue its use.  If you register ARJ,
     you may continue to use the unregistered ARJ program until you receive
     the registered version.

     For the purposes of this license, a SITE is considered a group of
     computers/users provided primary technical support from one location.
     This definition of a SITE is subject to change.

     Each computer that uses ARJ requires licensing.  In addition,
     computers that are being backed up with ARJ via a file server require
     licensing.  For example, if computer Z's data is copied to a file
     server and that file server uses ARJ to archive Z's data, then
     computer Z needs to be licensed for ARJ.

     Examples of institutional or commercial use of ARJ:

     1)  Using ARJ to backup your business programs and/or data.
     2)  Using ARJ to create archives for storing or transporting data.
     3)  Using ARJ on a company supplied home computer for company
	 business.
     4)  Using ARJ to backup your research programs and/or data.
     5)  Using ARJ on your home business computer for business purposes.

     The above examples should NOT be construed as the ONLY types of
     institutional or commercial use of ARJ.


     SHAREWARE DISTRIBUTION USE BY INDIVIDUALS:

     The use of ARJ to create an ARJ format archive (*.ARJ) for the purpose
     of distributing shareware or freeware to computer bulletin board
     systems IS NOT considered commercial use.	However, any other use of
     ARJ in connection with a shareware product IS commercial use.  For
     example, using ARJ to backup shareware source code IS commercial use.


     DISTRIBUTION LICENSE:

     Standard ARJ format archives (*.ARJ) may be distributed without a
     license.  The UNARJ.EXE program distributed separately may be freely
     used and distributed without a license.

     Any corporation, institution, government agency or business wishing to
     include DEARJ, ARJSFX or ARJSFXJR as an integral part of a software
     and/or hardware package to be distributed externally for the purpose
     of saving diskette space must purchase a DISTRIBUTION LICENSE.  The
     use of ARJ on one computer to build the software and/or hardware
     package is included in the DISTRIBUTION LICENSE.

     Please write for terms providing details of expected distribution
     numbers per year, required diskettes before and after compression, a
     description of the software/hardware and the specific ARJ software to
     be used in the distribution.

     If you wish to use the archiver ARJ or the conversion program REARJ in
     your application software, the pricing is similar to the INTERNAL SITE
     LICENSE price schedule.  Please write for terms.


     RELIGIOUS ORGANIZATIONAL USE:

     To obtain the donation of a SITE LICENSE and/or DISTRIBUTION LICENSE,
     please write providing details of your organization's religious and
     charitable activities and the intended use for ARJ.  A free license
     will be provided to qualifying organizations.  Qualifications will be
     determined on a purely subjective basis.  Non-qualifying organizations
     can always obtain licenses by purchase.


     COMMERCIAL SALE:

     Any software dealer or library may distribute the entire ARJ package
     in an unmodified form for a fee as long as the price charged for the
     disk containing ARJ does not exceed US $10.00.  You may NOT distribute
     any version of ARJR or DEARJ (not the same as UNARJ).

     With this single exception, the sale of ARJ or its parts for profit,
     either alone or together with other software or hardware, requires a
     licensing agreement providing for royalty payments.  Please write for
     terms.


     CUSTOM VERSIONS OF ARJ:

     Customized versions of ARJ can be licensed.  Please write for terms
     describing your requirements.  Customized versions may take a few days
     to several weeks or more to build.


     UNARJ SOURCE CODE:

     Available in a separately distributed archive is the program UNARJ.EXE
     and its C source code.  UNARJ is a simple ARJ archive extraction
     program.

     You may freely use, copy, and distribute UNARJ.EXE, provided that no
     fee is charged for such use, copying or distribution.

     This source code is intended to promote the building of utilities to
     support the use of ARJ and ARJ archives.


     ARJ SOURCE CODE:

     The ANSI C source code for ARJ may be obtained under a license
     arrangement with a non-disclosure policy.	I am currently limiting
     source licenses to large firms.

     Please write for terms.


     ARJ-SECURITY ENVELOPE USE:

     This feature is intended for but not limited to software developers
     who wish to distribute archived software with some assurance that the
     archived software in a validated ARJ-SECURED archive will be secure.
     I reserve the right to limit the distribution of ARJ-SECURITY serial
     numbers.

     This feature may ONLY be used by those who have purchased an
     ARJ-SECURITY serial number.

     Please see the ORDERFRM.DOC or write for terms.
