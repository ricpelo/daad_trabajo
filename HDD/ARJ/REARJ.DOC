     INTRODUCTION:

     REARJ is an archive conversion program designed to facilitate the
     conversion of LZH, ZIP, PAK, ARC, DWC, HYP, LZS, and ZOO archives to
     the ARJ format.  In addition, this converter has been designed to
     convert to any of the aforementioned archive formats.


     MAJOR FEATURES:

     Supports all major archiver programs (PAK, LHARC, PKZIP, ZOO, ARJ,
     PKPAK, DWC, HYPER, LARC, LHA).

     Supports file attributes within archives.

     Supports directories within archives.

     Supports converting archives within archives (ZIPs in a ZIP).

     Ensures reliable archive conversion with a file count and total size
     check.

     Supports the conversion of archives on diskettes.

     Supports the use of virus checkers and BBS ad removers.

     Supports absolute pathname extraction using the /w option.

     Supports pathnames with drive letters.

     Is command line driven.

     Supports recursive scanning through subdirectories.

     Optional logging of conversions.

     Simulation option.


     A WORD OF CAUTION:

     If you plan to convert many archives at one time, it is STRONGLY
     suggested that you make a backup of your hard disk.  This is a wise
     precaution to take anytime that you make major modifications to data
     on your hard disk drive.

     The standard REARJ conversion will does NOT convert any archive
     comments and volume labels.  They will be lost.

     I have discovered that LHA using the "x" command does not return an
     error when encountering a DISK FULL situation.  This will cause data
     loss!!!  You should scan the log file after a conversion to look for
     any major archive size differences.

     If the archives you are converting will ONLY extract to absolute
     paths, you must use the /w option to set the working directory to an
     empty root directory such as a RAMDRIVE.  This will allow extraction
     to the root.

     REARJ and the archiver executables must be located in the DOS PATH
     directories. This is due to REARJ creating and using a temporary
     directory.

     If you have changed the MS-DOS switch character from "/" to another
     character via an undocumented MS-DOS interrupt or the TurboC
     setswitchar() function, REARJ may not work properly with the default
     REARJ.CFG configuration file.

     The most thorough testing was done with ARJ as the target format and
     ZIP as the original format.  In any case, you should verify that the
     extract commands of your favorite archive formats in the configuration
     file are correct.	The extract commands are the most important to get
     right because REARJ has a built-in verification procedure to ensure
     that the ADD commands executed properly.

     Be sure you have enough disk space on your working directory to
     extract the largest archive that you want to convert!!!


     The versions of archivers tested:

     ARJ   1.00, 1.10, 2.00, 2.10, 2.20
     LHA   2.12
     PAK   2.51
     PKZIP 1.10
     PKPAK 3.61
     ZOO   2.01
     DWC   A5.01
     LARC  3.33
     HYPER 2.5


     INSTALLATION:

     Copy REARJ.EXE and REARJ.CFG to one of the DOS PATH directories.  They
     do not have to be placed in the same directory.  The PATH directories
     are usually set by the PATH command in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file.

     Be sure the archivers and virus scanner are installed in a DOS PATH
     directory.

     If you have the new SCAN version 80, you should modify the VIRUS line
     in REARJ.CFG to the following:

     VIRUS scan /nomem /sub *.*

     This will allow virus scanning in any extracted directories.


     OPERATION OF REARJ:

     REARJ will build a temporary directory in the current directory and
     extract the archive(s) to this directory.	REARJ will then build the
     target archive(s) with the files in this directory.  If the target
     archiver does not support reading of hidden or system files, REARJ
     will reset those bits and then re-archive the files without those
     attributes.  If the original archive has directories in it, REARJ will
     extract it with full paths and re-archive it with full paths if the
     target archiver supports directories.  In this case, if the archiver
     does not support directories, REARJ will skip converting this archive.

     If the "/a" option has been selected, REARJ will execute REARJ to
     convert any internal archives of the same type to the target format.
     Any "/s" option will be carried over to the recursive REARJ command.

     As an extra test, REARJ will count the files extracted from the
     original archive and total their sizes.  Then REARJ will extract the
     new archive and count the files and total the sizes.  If the count and
     size do not match, REARJ will skip converting the archive.

     REARJ assumes that the supported archivers will pass a non-zero error
     code when there is an operation failure.


     COMMAND SYNTAX:

     REARJ [switch options] filespec(s) or wildspec(s)

     You can specify one or more filespecs on the command line.  These
     filespecs can have paths and wildcards.  Up to 100 filespecs can be
     accepted by REARJ.  If you specify *.* as a wildspec, REARJ will look
     at all filenames, but will skip those filenames not ending in standard
     archive suffixes.	If you specify the /r switch, REARJ will look for
     filenames matching the filespec(s) in the current directory and all
     subdirectories of the current directory.

     If you want to use a RAMDRIVE as the temporary directory, you must
     make the RAMDRIVE the current drive and directory and execute REARJ
     commands from there.

     The switch options and filespecs can be entered in any order.  REARJ
     uses the default MS-DOS switch character "/".  REARJ uses the Turbo
     C++ function getswitchar() to determine the MS-DOS switch character.
     If the switch character is "-", REARJ will translate any UNIX style
     pathnames to MS-DOS syntax ("dir/file" to "dir\file").


     SWITCH OPTIONS:

     /a - convert archives within archives

	  This option causes REARJ to recursively execute REARJ to convert
	  any archives of the original type found within the original
	  archive (ex. ZIPs within a ZIP).  This option requires additional
	  memory to execute successfully.

	  You may specify the type of internal archive to convert with the
	  "/a" option.

	  Examples:  REARJ *.zip /aLZH	convert only internal LZH archives.
		     REARJ *.zip /a*	convert any internal archive.

	  NOTE!!!  When using the "/a" option, REARJ.EXE and REARJ.CFG must
	  be installed in a DOS PATH directory because the recursive REARJ
	  will be executed within a temporary directory and NOT in the
	  original directory.

     /b - execute command before extracting files

	  This option is used to specify a DOS command to be executed before
	  extracting the original archive.

	  In addition, REARJ passes the name of the original archive to
	  this command as a command line argument when executing it.  This
	  may cause a problem with DOS commands that expect no arguments.
	  A workaround would be to install the DOS command in a batch file.

	  This feature is to allow the user to prep the environment before
	  extracting the archive.  This can be used to prep for archive
	  comments or volume labels, etc.

     /c - execute command on extracted files before counting them

	  This option is used to specify a DOS command to be executed upon
	  the extracted files before REARJ counts them for later
	  verification.  This is to allow executing a DOS or batch command
	  to clean up the extracted files (remove BBS advertisements, etc).
	  REARJ does not check for any returned error code from the
	  executed command.

	  In addition, REARJ passes the name of the original archive to
	  this command as a command line argument when executing it.  This
	  may cause a problem with DOS commands that expect no arguments.
	  A workaround would be to install the DOS command in a batch file.

     /d - delete the original archive

	  This option causes REARJ to delete the original archive after a
	  successful conversion to the target format.  This option will NOT
	  delete read-only archives.

     /e - do not return error if no archives were found

	  This option is used by the internal recursive REARJ.	This option
	  will cause REARJ to return a zero exit code if no matching
	  archives were found.	Usually, REARJ returns a non-zero exit
	  code for this condition.

     /f - convert diskette archives

	  This option is used to facilitate the conversion of archives on a
	  diskette.  If you do not have sufficient space on the diskette to
	  keep the original archives, you MUST specify the "/d" option as
	  in "REARJ A:*.zip /f /d".

	  This option causes REARJ to build the target archive in the
	  CURRENT directory (not the working temporary directory).  After
	  verification, REARJ will, if specified, delete the original
	  archive and then copy the new archive to the diskette.  You
	  should make sure that the current directory does not contain any
	  archives before executing REARJ.

     /i - check program integrity

	  This option causes REARJ to validate the REARJ program on disk.
	  If you are using a pre-3.0 MS-DOS revision, you will have to
	  specify the full program name as in "REARJ /i\util\rearj.exe".

     /l - write conversion data to log file

	  This option causes REARJ to open a log file and record each
	  successful conversion in the log file.  The default log file name
	  is REARJ.LOG.  You can specify the log file name as in
	  "REARJ /lfilename *.ZIP".  If the log file already exists, REARJ
	  will append logging data to it.

     /o - overwrite existing target archive

	  This switch is used to delete already existing target archives.
	  This is not used for updating archives.  Use the /u option for
	  updating an archive.

     /q - query for each archive to convert

	  This switch causes REARJ to pause and prompt the user for
	  permission to convert individual archives.  Note that REARJ will
	  not prompt when skipping archives.

     /r - recurse through subdirectories

	  This switch causes REARJ to look for archives in all included
	  subdirectories as well as in the current directory.  This switch
	  allows the user to convert all archives on a hard disk with one
	  command.

     /s - skip verify of file count and total size

	  Skip the overhead of the file count and total size verification
	  process.  This verification costs an extra extraction, but this
	  check is worth the time, especially when converting a large
	  number of archives.

     /t - specify the target archive type

	  The default target archive format is normally ARJ.  This can be
	  changed by building an external REARJ.CFG file.  The first
	  archive type is always the default format.  To override the
	  default format, the user can specify the /t switch as in
	  "REARJ *.ZIP /tlzh".	The previous example has specified that LZH
	  is the target format.

     /u - allow update of archive with backup

	  This switch is used to re-archive an archive, possibly to take
	  advantage of improved compression.  The original archive is
	  backed up by renaming it with the backup suffix which by default
	  is "BAK".  You may specify another backup suffix with the /u
	  option as in "REARJ *.ARJ /uar$" where the backup suffix is
	  "ar$".  Since this option creates a brand new archive, archive
	  comments will be lost.  Do NOT specify a "." in the suffix.

     /v - execute configured command on extracted files

	  This switch is used to execute a configure command on the files
	  extracted from the original archive.	The intent is to allow
	  virus scanning of the archive contents.  The command must be
	  specified in the REARJ.CFG file.

	  The command may be placed in the REARJ.CFG file by inserting one
	  line ahead of the archive commands.  The line must start with the
	  word "VIRUS" followed by a blank and the external command.

	  Example:  VIRUS scan /nomem *.*

	  If the invoked command returns a non-zero error code, REARJ will
	  skip the conversion of that archive and log the error as code 13.

	  REARJ *.* /v

     /w - set working directory

	  By default, REARJ creates a temporary working directory in the
	  current directory.  This option allows you to specify the working
	  directory.  The working directory must be EMPTY when invoking
	  REARJ.  This directory is used to hold the extracted files.
	  This is NOT considered the current directory for /f use.

	  Example:  REARJ *.* /wd:\

	  This option helps solve the absolute pathname extraction problem
	  that some archivers have.  If you set the working directory to an
	  empty root directory, the archiver can extract to the root and
	  REARJ will be able to find all of the files to re-archive them.
	  However, this option will NOT work for internal archives that
	  extract to absolute paths.

     /x - exclude filenames or wildnames from the conversion process

	  You can exclude one or more files from the conversion process.
	  The filenames can contain wildcards.

	  REARJ *.ZIP /xONE.ZIP /xTWO.ZIP

     /z - simulate conversion process

	  This switch causes REARJ to simulate the conversion process.	No
	  archives will be extracted, built, or deleted.


     EXAMPLES:

     REARJ *.ZIP		   this converts all ZIP files in the current
				   directory to ARJ files.

     REARJ *.ZIP *.ARC		   this converts ZIP and ARC files to ARJ
				   files.

     REARJ SOFT.ZIP		   this converts only SOFT.ZIP to SOFT.ARJ.

     REARJ A:*.ZIP /f /d	   convert ZIPs on A drive with deletion of
				   each original archive upon successful
				   conversion.

     REARJ *.ZIP /d /l		   this converts ZIP files with logging and
				   deletion of each original archive upon
				   successful conversion.

     REARJ *.ARC /r		   this converts all ARC files in the current
				   directory and in subdirectories of the
				   current directory to ARJ files.

     REARJ SOFT.ARJ /tZIP	   this converts SOFT.ARJ to SOFT.ZIP.

     REARJ *.ARJ /u		   re-archive all ARJ archives.

     REARJ *.* /v /wd:\ 	   re-archive all archives and execute
				   configured command on extracted files
				   using d:\ as the temp directory.


     EXTERNAL CONFIGURATION FILE

     REARJ comes with a configuration file, REARJ.CFG, which supports
     conversion between the ARJ, ARC, LZH, PAK, ZIP, DWC, LZS, HYP, and ZOO
     formats.  The commands PKPAK and PKUNPAK are used for ARC files.  The
     command LHA is used for LZH files.  You can change these defaults by
     editing the configuration file.

     The format of the configuration file is fairly simple.

     The first line can optionally specify an external command to be
     executed by REARJ when the "/v" option is selected.  This line must
     start with the word "VIRUS" minus the quotes, followed by a space,
     followed by the external command.

     Example:  VIRUS SCAN /nomem *.*

     If you do not want to configure this item, DO NOT insert a blank line.

     Each archive format requires four lines in the file.

     The first line is the format suffix.

     The second line is the archive ADD command with a %s in the place of
     the archive name.	Any other percent signs in the command must be
     preceded by "\" as in "\%".  The ADD command should support directory
     inclusion and reading of hidden and/or system files.  REARJ will parse
     this command line using the space character as the token separator.

     If your ADD command requires DOS piping as the ZOO archiver requires,
     you must precede the ADD command with the text "COMMAND /C ".

     Example:  ARJ a -a -r -jt %s
	       COMMAND /C STUFF *.* | ZOO aI %s

     The third line is the archive EXTRACT command with a %s in the
     place of the archive name.  Any other percent signs in the command
     must be preceded by "\" as in "\%".  The EXTRACT command should
     support directory recreation if the archive contains directories.
     The extraction of directories must be to child directories within the
     current directory.  REARJ will parse this command line using the space
     character as the token separator.

     If your EXTRACT command requires DOS piping, you must precede the
     EXTRACT command with the text "COMMAND /C ".  Beware that command exit
     codes are not passed back to REARJ when using COMMAND /C.

     The fourth line contains the letters "A" and/or "D" or no letters.
     The "A" stands for the ability to process files with the hidden and/or
     system attribute.	The "D" stands for full support of directory trees
     within archives.  No letters (blank line) stands for no support for
     hidden or system files or for archive containing directories.

     There must be NO EXTRA blank lines or comments in the file.  You may
     use leading blanks for clarity.

     The first format type declared in the configuration file is used by
     REARJ as its default target format.   REARJ.CFG is currently setup
     with ARJ as its default target format.

     The following is the current REARJ.CFG configuration:

     VIRUS scan /nomem *.*
     ARJ
      ARJ a -a+ -r+ -y+ -jt+ %s
      ARJ x -y+ %s
      AD
     ZIP
      PKZIP -a -r -p -wHS %s
      PKUNZIP -d %s
      AD
     ARC
      PKPAK -a %s
      PKUNPAK %s

     LZH
      LHA a /a+ /r+ /x+ %s
      LHA x /a+ %s
      AD
     PAK
      PAK a /i %s
      PAK e /path %s
      AD
     ZOO
      COMMAND /C STUFF *.* | ZOO aI %s
      ZOO x.// %s *
      D
     HYP
      HYPER -a -r -p %s
      HYPER -x -p %s .
      AD
     DWC
      DWC a %s *.*
      DWC e %s

     LZS
      LARC a /r %s *.*
      LARC e /x %s *.*
      D

     If you use a different archiver program, you will need to either
     rename the program to one of the supported ones or you will need to
     modify the installed REARJ.CFG file.

     DWC does not allow duplicate filenames even within a directory
     structure, so "D" is not set for DWC.

     LARC may or may not work correctly for archives with directories.	I
     was unable to stop LARC from querying on making directories.

     If your original archive format supports extraction to absolute
     directory paths as opposed to relative directory paths and you have
     such archives containing absolute paths, you should not put directory
     extraction in the REARJ.CFG file unless you use the /w option to set
     the working directory to an empty root directory.

     You can add comment handling to the ARJ command by adding the
     "-zcomment.txt" option.  This is supported at ARJ 2.20 and above.


     LOG FILE DATA

     When logging is enabled, REARJ will log the action on each selected
     file.  For successful conversions, REARJ logs the date-time, target
     archive type, original archive size, new archive size, bytes saved,
     and original archive name.

     When selected files are skipped for any reason, REARJ will log an
     entry in the log file (when logging is enabled) which specifies the
     reason code for skipping the file.  The following are the codes:

     1	= File not found
     2	= File is not a configured archive type
     3	= Target archive already exists
     4	= Not enough disk space
     5	= User skipped or user did not select update option
     6	= UNPACK error
     7	= PACK error
     8	= Target cannot support directories
     9	= Wrong file count
     10 = Wrong total size
     11 = Internal archive REARJ error
     12 = Rename archive error
     13 = Invoked /v command error (found a virus?)
