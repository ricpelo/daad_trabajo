
     UPDATE.DOC, ARJ 2.20				      July 1991


     This documents new or updated information since ARJ 2.10.


     ** IMPORTANT NEWS ****************************************************

	The UNARJ software is now distributed separately in an archive
	named UNARJ220.EXE.

	The "-ji" index file option now appends to instead of overwriting
	an existing index file.

	The second user prompt for the "w" command has been changed to
	ask for the number of match context lines.

	You may now register ARJ via credit card through Public Software
	Library.  See CREDIT.CRD for more information.

     **********************************************************************


     ARJR and DEARJ programs

	The new programs ARJR and DEARJ are available only to registered
	users of ARJ.  ARJR is the ARJ program minus the help screen and
	SFX modules.  DEARJ is the ARJR program minus the archive
	creation/modification functions.  DEARJ is used for commercial
	software distributions involving multiple volume archives.  See the
	LICENSE.DOC and ORDERFRM.DOC for more information.


     ARJ SFX MODULES

	The ARJ self-extraction modules have been improved in terms of
	speed.	The "-je" module is slightly faster than ARJ in extraction
	speed. The one BIOS call that the SFX modules used has been removed
	to provide better compatibility with partial IBM compatibles.

	Both SFX modules have an identification string located in the first
	1000 characters of the executable.  The identification string is
	"aRJsfX" without the quotes.


     ARJ COMMANDS

     "e" or "x" commands

	During the extraction display, ARJ will display only one filename
	if the "from" and "to" filenames are identical.


     "f" and "u" commands

	ARJ will not physically update an archive when no files and no
	comments have been added to the archive.  In other words, the
	date-time stamp both internally and externally (DOS) will remain
	unchanged.


     "o" command

	The ARJ "o" command will abort when attempted on a multiple volume
	archive.


     "p" command

	The switch option "-jp" will force the "p" command into a paged
	display mode like the DOS MORE command.


     "w" command

	The context message prompt has been changed.  Instead of asking if
	the user wants to display the context of any matches, ARJ asks how
	many lines of context to display.  An answer of "0" (zero) will
	disable the display of string match context.


     ARJ SWITCHES

	The switch character handling has been modified to allow a
	different switch character to be used in ARJ_SW and in the command
	line except when the option "-ju" (unix) has been specified.  This
	will prevent problems when using the ARJ_SW variable and archiver
	shell programs that use a different switch character.

	If the ARJ_SW environment variable specifies a filename (text not
	beginning with a switch character), ARJ will open that filename and
	scan it looking for a line of text that begins in column 1 with the
	same letter as the ARJ command being executed.	The following text
	is processed as the ARJ_SW switches.  This allows each ARJ command
	to have its own switch settings.  If no such command text is found,
	then no switch settings are processed as the ARJ_SW switches.

	SET ARJ_SW=C:\ARJ\ARJ.CFG

	C:\ARJ\ARJ.CFG contains:
	a -jm1 -jt -i1
	l -jp
	e -i1
	c -zcomment.txt


     "-$" switch

	Adding a non-existent volume label will NOT produce a warning or
	error code.


     "-a" switch

	ARJ will correctly scan hidden directories with the "-a" and "-a1"
	options.


     "-d" switch

	The "-d" switch option now works for the "j" command.


     "-m" switch

	Methods 3 and 4 are significantly faster and more compressive.
	Method 4 compression is almost twice as fast as the default method
	1 compression.


     "-v" switch

	The "-vv" option will beep after the last volume.  This may be used
	on a single archive creation by using a command similar to this:

	ARJ a -vv9999K archive *.*

	When using the "-va" option, ARJ will prompt concerning disk space
	when there is less than 10,000 bytes free.


     "-z" switch

	The "-z" comment switch works with other modification functions
	besides the "c" command.  This allows you to add a comment at the
	same time as you add files to an archive.

	Example:  ARJ a -zcomment.txt archive *.doc


     "-ji" switch

	The "-ji" has been changed to append the filename logging
	information to an already existing file.


     "-jl" switch

	The "-jl" switch forces ARJ to display only the filespec of
	filenames for the different progress displays.


     "-jw" switch

	The "-jw" switch allows you to specify the output filename for
	extracted data.  When using this switch, you should only select one
	file for extraction.  This is similar but not exactly the same as
	using the "p" command with DOS output redirection.  Using DOS
	redirection would cause all of the output of the extraction to be
	put into the output file.  Using "-jw" would cause ARJ to prompt
	for overwrite permission per each file extracted to the output
	file.

	Example:  ARJ e -jwfile2.doc archive file1.doc

	In the above example, ARJ puts the data from "file1.doc" in the
	archive into the file "file2.doc".


     "-jx" switch

	The "-jx" switch during extraction mode allows the user to specify
	the file position to start in the output file.	This can be used to
	append data to an existing file.

	Example:  ARJ e -jx10000 archive file1

	This is similar to using the command "ARJ p archive >> output".
	To duplicate this redirection with ARJ would require the following:

	ARJ e -jx2000K -jwoutput archive


     "-jy" switch

	The "-jy" option allows you to specify the new option characters
	"y" and "r".  The "y" option sets ARJ to use single character
	Y/N/A/Q query prompts (yes, no, always, quit).	The "r" option
	sets ARJ to erase all typeahead before user queries.

	Example:  ARJ e -jyyr archive	  set single character query
					  and erase typeahead.

	You may set the "-jyyr" option in the environment variable ARJ_SW.
	There is no way to override such an option once selected.
