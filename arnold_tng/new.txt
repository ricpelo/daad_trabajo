--------
- arnold started up with something that looked like a cpc6128 but was cassette based.
now fixed. arnold starts with a real cpc6128 configuration.
- started to implement a new "load file into ram" option. Not finished yet but I was going to use
this to run some tests with arnold.

December 2008
-------------
- it was not possible to insert an expansion rom (now fixed). clicking on load button would not do anything.
- lots of dissassembly errors fixed. Some instructions were wrong, some were not formatted correctly. Some
were inconsistent. 
- If Arnold failed to auto-start a disc it would not tell you.
- If Arnold failed to auto-start a disc it would leave  autotype on and would print garbage.  Cpc would hang.
- If Arnold failed to auto-start a disc it would leave autotype on, reset did not stop it. Cpc would be hung after reset.
- Failed to autostart discs where directory had graphics and the only file to run was hidden.
- Can now load 256k and 512k snapshots. 
- Much more tolerant to bad snapshots (bad length).
- Can now autostart disc/tape on cpc+. 
- compressed memory blocks in snapshot v3 are now supported (snapshots written by winape should now load)
- disc image filename blocks in snapshot v3 specification are now supported (snapshots written by winape should now load)
- scroll lock led no longer reflects drive led. it was not useful because it only reflected the state of the internal drive anyway.



November 2008
-------------

Fixes:
- Ukonx tracker now loads.
- Last Ninja 2 Remix (protected disc image) can now be inserted without Arnold crashing
- Natural Bug Killer demo now runs


- Inserting some disc images would cause Arnold to crash.
- Fixed bug with CPC+ snapshot loading/saving. Some snapshots identify themselves for CPC
old generation, but if a CPC+ special block is found it is assumed CPC+ is used.
- Fixed a bug in the fdc emulation meaning Natural Bug Killers would hang after intro part.
